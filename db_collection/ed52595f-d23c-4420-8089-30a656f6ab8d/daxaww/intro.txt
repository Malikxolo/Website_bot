Q-Introduce your self?
A- Hi, my name is Faizan AHmad, and I Completed my B.tech from Ambalika Institue of management and technology,and I also have a strong interest in backend and cloud-based development.I also completed my 10th standard wiht 80% and 12th standard with 85% from Unity College. and I’ve worked on multiple hands-on projects that helped me build real-world experience with AWS, Java, and serverless technologies.

One of my main projects was an Image Processing Pipeline using AWS Lambda in Java. I automated the blurring of images uploaded to S3 and used Lambda Layers to reduce the deployment size by 60%. The function processed images in under 1 second across different environments. 

I also built a real-time chat application using AWS WebSocket API Gateway, Lambda (Node.js), and DynamoDB. It handled real-time communication with session sync and low latency across tabs, supporting more than 10 concurrent users.

In another project, I deployed a static React website using S3 and CloudFront with CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions. This reduced load times by 45% and enabled zero-downtime deployments on every commit.

During my final semester, I led the development of a Resume Recommendation System as part of my major group project. We used Python, Flask, and NLTK to build a system that could match resumes to job descriptions with 85% accuracy. I was primarily responsible for building the backend logic, designing the database in MySQL, and implementing keyword-based matching and ranking algorithms. We also built a responsive frontend and wrote automated test scripts that helped catch and resolve critical bugs before deployment

These projects not only helped me sharpen my technical skills but also taught me how to design scalable systems and work with real-world tools like AWS, GitHub Actions, and relational databases. I'm excited to bring this experience to a professional environment and continue learning
